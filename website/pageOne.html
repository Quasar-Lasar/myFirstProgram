    <h1>A portfolio of my favourite projects</h1>
    <h2>Pizza shop order program</h2>
    <p>I enjoyed making this program, it included most of the knowledge i have learnt through 100 days of code. It works by taking taking an order in and working out how much the total is at the end. Once the order is done, it can be deleted from the database.</p>

    <h2>Log in system</h2>
    <p>Another project i enjoyed is the one i did about a log in system. This program saves the password in a seperate file and hashes the password. This makes the password harder to figure out if it found by hackers.</p>

    <h2>Graphic novel</h2>
    <p>This one was fun, i used one of the first fps games i ever played and used some of the images to make a small graphic novel. I used the tkinter library to make this program work. </p>
